### Enterprise SaaS Platform Serves 40 Billion Feature Flags Daily for over 500 Businesses Across the Globe


_Originally released on [PRNewswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/launchdarkly-celebrates-500th-customer-3x-revenue-growth-and-inclusion-in-forbes-2018-rising-stars-300737553.html), Oct. 25, 2018._

Today, LaunchDarkly, the leading Feature Management company, announced over 500 businesses are now using its platform to build software applications and release new features faster, with less risk. With LaunchDarkly, businesses decouple the deployment of software features from the availability of those features to application users, expediting the software development process and gaining fine-grained control over the customer experience.

"These are tremendous milestones for LaunchDarkly," said Edith Harbaugh, CEO and Co-founder of LaunchDarkly. "They validate what we've always believed - that businesses need to move faster to stay competitive, but at the same time need to ensure they deliver amazing experiences to their customers. Without Feature Management, it's been nearly impossible for businesses to accomplish both of these goals at the same time."

LaunchDarkly counts global businesses across a variety of industries as customers, including blue chip companies Microsoft, Pitney Bowes, and Intuit - as well as high-growth companies Atlassian, Invision, Procore and PluralSight. Customers have adopted LaunchDarkly as they modernize their software development practices to progressively deliver new features and applications to their customers.

LaunchDarkly's inclusion in the Forbes 2018 Rising Star further validates feature management's impact on software delivery. Harbaugh adds, "It's truly an honor to be recognized by Forbes for the transformation we're leading in the industry. Just a few years ago, John (co-founder) and I conceptualized LaunchDarkly in our shared office space at Oakstop in Oakland. Now, we employ over 60 people in a much bigger Oakland office where we proudly serve our 500 plus customers using our Feature Management platform on a daily basis."
