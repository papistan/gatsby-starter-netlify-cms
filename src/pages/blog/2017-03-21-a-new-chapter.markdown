## A new chapter


Having spent the past two plus years in the consumer space at Good Eggs, my first week at LaunchDarkly has been an absolute whirlwind experience. From getting acquainted with the development process to meeting our amazing team, the on-boarding process has been, albeit daunting, very warm and welcoming.


## Getting up to speed


As part of getting up to up to speed in my first week, I've been diving in to the stack. John has been a fantastic pair and resource for not only the current lay of the land, but also providing valuable historical context around the product's evolution. I still have a lot to learn, but am feeling better equipped every day.


## Back and the future


Before joining the team at LaunchDarkly, I was particularly impressed with the product and its evolution. Feature flagging, to me, permeates beyond a software development process to defining how organizations—really people within organizations—work together to deliver the best possible experience to the end user. After seeing how LaunchDarkly works from inside and with its customers, I'm happy to report that I was not only right, but there is so much more to it!

I'm looking forward working on this empowering, impactful product with our incredible team and can't wait to be a part of LaunchDarkly's future.
