LaunchDarkly is by far the earliest startup I have been a part of, and from day one, I felt a responsibility and opportunity to contribute to its limitless potential. I considered my last company a startup (around 400 employees when I joined), but I have quickly realized that was not an accurate description. While there was some startup culture still present (and that's what I liked about it), LaunchDarkly embodies everything I could want from a startup.

It all starts with the product and the market opportunity. As a sales professional I was looking for a product that had [a positive reception from customers](https://blog.launchdarkly.com/leading-feature-flag-platform-launchdarkly-announces-industry-topping-nps/) and stories of providing real value- this was evident on day one. From a new user excited to set up their first [feature flag](http://featureflags.io/feature-flags/), to a current customer relaying that LaunchDarkly has completely revolutionized their dev process for the better- it has been all positive feedback so far.

A great product is built by a great team, and I have enjoyed getting to know this team over the past week. If I were to describe the team in one word, it would be “brilliant.” I am very grateful to come to work every day and be surrounded by people smarter than me that I can learn from and be challenged by. We all eat lunch together each day and while it is a casual hang out, I learn something new every time we sit down together.

No company can predict its future success, but if I were a betting man, I’d put my chips on LaunchDarkly. I am excited to help companies further their continuous delivery efforts and Launch our company to new heights!
