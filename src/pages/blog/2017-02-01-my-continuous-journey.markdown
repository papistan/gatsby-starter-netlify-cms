I spent that last two and half years working at Intercom, helping build a sales team in San Francisco and Dublin and then a global sales engineering team. One of the most important things I have learned from Intercom is that if you want to have the best product on the market you need to push new product fast, in fact failing fast is more important than succeeding slow.




After my first week at LaunchDarkly, I am ready to help businesses understand why continuously delivering product is so key to gaining market share, building the best product for the market and your customers, and [safely deploying at scale](https://blog.launchdarkly.com/risk-reduction-and-harm-mitigation/).




Edith and John have built a fantastic team, everyone has been so welcoming and helpful getting me up to speed. I have spent most of my time diving into the product and infrastructure. I also have been jumping on customer calls so I can understand the jobs customers are using LaunchDarkly for. So far, I am impressed by the customerâ€™s eagerness to use feature flagging, from large enterprises to small startups. I am also impressed on the number of use cases that LaunchDarkly can help provide value.




I am really excited to be part of this team and to help build something that is going to help change the way companies work.




To the current LaunchDarkly team, thank you for having me! To the future ones, come join us.
