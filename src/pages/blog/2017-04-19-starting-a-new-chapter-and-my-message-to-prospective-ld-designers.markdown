_**Wow, what a journey. **_

I joined LaunchDarkly in 2015 as employee #3 and first design hire. Every day since then, I learned something new about the product, the team, and myself. I learned from the best and brightest: from John and Edith's unparalleled enthusiasm and leadership - to the engineering prowess of Alexis, Patrick, and Dan - to the marketing wizardry of Andrea.

For me, success is not how much money you can make... or your job title... or how many people you can manage... Success is the ability to be proud of what you have accomplished, to have helped others along the way, and to take care of your loved ones. It is also the ability to learn every day, to have a sense of wonder at the possibility of advancement, and to make a positive impact through your work.

Every single team member at LaunchDarkly is a genuinely good person. They are not here to play the Silicon Valley game, they are here to solve a problem with software releases and truly help companies deliver better software, faster. They envision a world where the LaunchDarkly product enables companies to accelerate innovation, spur new technology, and deliver more reliable software.

Though I love the team and I'm thrilled with the product, I've made the tough decision to start a new chapter in Southern California, home to my family and friends, at Ten-X (a happy LaunchDarkly customer!). I will miss LaunchDarkly dearly, but I know I did the best I could during my tenure.

## Design at LaunchDarkly


If you're a designer interested in LaunchDarkly, let me give you some insight into what it's like to work here.

Imagine a team of engineers who are brilliant, humble, supportive, and funny (gifs upon gifs!). Working with this team day after day has been a privilege and a whirlwind of a learning experience. They do not cut corners when it comes to code quality and product. You will absolutely learn best practices, innovative strategies, and work with a state-of-the-art stack. You will 100% become a better, smarter designer and make an immediate impact on the product. I guarantee you will be truly proud of what you design and the quality of its programmatic execution.

Your job will not be to push pixels. You will be a systemic thinker - someone who takes ownership of the design process from start to finish. You will learn to love our customers and take a personal interest in their happiness by building a world-class user experience.

Not only that, but every team member at LaunchDarkly is a designer in their own right. While you will be the one who will take ownership of design, the team enjoys contributing feedback and ideas, making the entire process collaborative and company-wide.


## To infinity... and beyond!


And on this note, I say goodbye to my second family as I make my transition from proud employee to happy customer. LaunchDarkly will continue to be the industry leader in feature flag management - a true disruptor and unicorn in the software development space. If you're a designer and you're thinking about LaunchDarkly, just do it.
