LaunchDarkly is a key piece of our customers' software development lifecycle. Quality and availability issues in our software impact the productivity of our customers' development teams, and so we strive to build our software in accordance with the best security, availability, and quality practices in the industry.

Our first step in Governance and Risk Management came when we achieved [SOC2 Type 2 Compliance](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/how-to-comply/). An external auditing team completed our SOC2 audit. We also achieved [GDPR/Privacy Shield](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/privacy-shield-and-gdpr/) certification, and follow best practices including bi-annual penetration tests performed by an external security team.

This year we've taken the next step down this path. We’re excited to announce that LaunchDarkly has achieved the ISO 27001:2013 certification for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). This certification affirms our dedication to the standards required by our customers and our commitment to quality process improvement as a company. It also shows that we are taking steps to systematically grade, and continually improve our systems.

Our industry recognizes ISO 27001:2013 as a top information security standard. It is published as an information security standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the world’s largest developer of voluntary international standards, as well as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The standard lays out the process for identifying requirements of a comprehensive ISMS. This defines the security controls used by organizations to manage and handle information, how and when we rate ourselves, to be confirmed and audited on an annual cadence by outside independent parties.

A-LIGN, an independent and accredited certification body, issued LaunchDarkly's certification after successful completion of a formal audit process. This certification is evidence we've met rigorous international standards. These standards ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our service.

We are the #1 Feature Management platform, serving over 200 billion features a day. This is a responsibility we take seriously—the reliability and integrity of our platform is a priority for our entire team. Optimizing our process enables our growth to the next order of magnitude.
