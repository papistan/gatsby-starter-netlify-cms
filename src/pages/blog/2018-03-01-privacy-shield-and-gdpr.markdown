In today's age, where your data goes and how it is used is a new, clear, and present danger that we all face. At LaunchDarkly, we believe that the your information is yours and not ours, and the information that you have about your customers should never be used in a way that they or you did not intend. We're pleased to announce that LaunchDarkly is amending and expanding our Privacy Policy to be [US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) and [General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (GDPR) Compliant.

I'm Tim Wong, the Data Protection Officer here at LaunchDarkly, and I would like to tell you about what how things are changing. First of all, we're making the commitment to never sell data in LaunchDarkly to third parties, so long as LaunchDarkly exists. Our customers pass their information to us in confidence and the Service Data that we collect will stay that way.

Secondly, we adhere to all of the guiding principles of the GDPR that will go live in the end of May. That includes the right to be forgotten, the right to know what data we have, and to not process data without consent. We submitted to having an independent third party audit our security/data protection/audit capabilities.

We're also committing to creating a [trust site](https://launchdarkly.com/policies/terms-of-service/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic) that tries to be clear about where we stand in plain (as we can have) English and to provide a clear English [changelog](https://launchdarkly.com/policies/archives/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic) should our policies ever change.

We understand that data, privacy, and GDPR is important to our customers and we look forward to partnering together moving forward. If you have any concerns, questions, and especially cookies to forward us (not the digital kind), please email me at [privacy@launchdarkly.com](mailto:privacy@launchdarkly.com)
