Today is a big day for LaunchDarkly - we moved into [Heavybit](http://www.heavybit.com/), a “community for developer-focused entrepreneurs”, in downtown San Francisco. Feedback from LaunchDarkly early customers like [Flite](http://mechanics.flite.com/blog/2014/10/14/feature-flags-at-flite/) and [Workhands](https://blog.launchdarkly.com//how-workhands-moves-quicker-building-better-applications-with-launchdarkly) is that LaunchDarkly is a key platform to allow software development teams to “move faster, break less, and measure everything”. The Heavybit team (James Lindenbaum, Tom Drummond, Dana Oshiro) heard how LaunchDarkly was “feature-flags-as-a-service” and invited us to join.

With Heavybit we’ll be in a community that’s convinced that not only will “software eat the world”, but that software needs better tools, platforms and services. We’ll be sitting with companies speeding development like Iron.io, CitusData, Apiary and CodeEnvy. I’ve already been thrilled with the high caliber of the Tuesday night speaker series and office hours with industry leaders. Jeff Atwood ([@CodingHorror](https://twitter.com/codinghorror)) ate dinner with our team before he gave a talk on building effective online communities like StackOverflow. [Craig Kerstiens](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/03/31/why-i-blog/) has helped us with our content-marketing strategy. Javier Soltero advised me on how intense iteration and quick development was a competitive advantage for Acompli. A special thanks to Russell Smith (Rainforest QA) for answering my questions about Heavybit.

And by the way, the Heavybit office is gorgeous! We’re very excited about this new chapter for LaunchDarkly.
