LaunchDarkly now supports .NET!

We’ve just released the first supported version of our .NET SDK. Like all our other SDKs (we support Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java, Go, and more), it’s open source— check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly/.net-client). We’ve also published a brand new [.NET reference guide](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/dotnet-sdk-reference) to help you dig in and integrate LaunchDarkly into your .NET application today.

Happy launching!
