[Velocity](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ny) is a great conference for ideas about where software and companies are going in the future. And I got a chance to talk with Mike Hendrickson about LaunchDarkly and feature management in that context. 

We think that feature management is a best practice for anyone who is trying to do continuous integration and deployment. Feature management gives you a way to test features in production quietly before making them visible to everyone. At the end of this interview we talked about what I think will happen in the future—I’m excited about the idea of giving users the exact page or experience they want and need.

If you're interested in learning a bit more about feature management or LaunchDarkly, take a few minutes to watch this video.
