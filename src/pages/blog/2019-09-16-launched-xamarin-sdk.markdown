We're excited to announce that the LaunchDarkly SDK for Xamarin is now available for use! With this announcement, the SDK has been promoted to general availability (GA).

[Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) allows for the cross-platform development of iOS, Android, and Windows applications. With Xamarin, engineering teams familiar with C# can build cross-platform applications with a single codebase, allowing for wider customer reach without the burden of having to maintain and develop against multiple platform-specific codebases.

With this release, more software teams than ever before are able to use LaunchDarkly. Check out the [Xamarin SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/xamarin-sdk-reference) for information on how to get started. If you have questions, reach out to our support team at [support@launchdarkly.com](mailto:support@launchdarkly.com).

Are you interesting in using LaunchDarkly with a different technology? With similar benefits to using our Xamarin SDK, customers who want to build:



 	
  * cross-platform mobile applications in React can use the LaunchDarkly SDK for [React Native](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/react-native-sdk-reference)

 	
  * native mobile applications can use the LaunchDarkly SDKs for [iOS](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/ios-sdk-reference) (Swift or Objective-C) or [Android](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/android-sdk-reference) (Java)
