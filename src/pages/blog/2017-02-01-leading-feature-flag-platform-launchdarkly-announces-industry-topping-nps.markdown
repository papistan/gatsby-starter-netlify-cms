I’m thrilled that LaunchDarkly, the leading feature flag management platform, has a Net Promoter Score of 50! Net Promoter Score is a measure of how much customers are willing to recommend a product. [30 is an average score for a tech vendor,](https://experiencematters.blog/2016/09/14/report-tech-vendor-nps-benchmark-2016-b2b/) so to be in top tier of tech vendors is wonderful validation for us. But the NPS score is just a scalar. What I really enjoyed hearing was customer appreciation of how LaunchDarkly’s feature flag platform was easy to use, reliable and powerful. We help less risky better releases, allowing business users and developers to collaborate for an overall transformative experience. LaunchDarkly customers are happy that they don't have to build a feature flagging platform in house. Don’t take my word for it - here’s what our customers have to say:

**Transformative**



 	
  * “Feature flags are the future, you help reduce the barrier-to-entry.”

 	
  * “It's amazing - changed the way we release new features.”

 	
  * “It's cool tech that works well. Encourages good develop and release practices.”

 	
  * “Launch Darkly is a really good service and should be used for good software practices.”


**Ease of Use**



 	
  * “Very convenient and fast way to roll-out new feature to users.”

 	
  * “Very easy to use. Easy to setup targets. Easy to roll out and rollback if needed.”

 	
  * “It offers more flexibility and ease of toggling new/development features with the rollout and inclusion/exclusion features than our previous solution.”

 	
  * “Much better way to introduce a new or changed functionality, compared to configuration changes”

 	
  * “Easy to use. Great UI”

 	
  * “Really like how configurable things are in LD, esp access controls, etc. Very easy to use”


**Reliable and Powerful**



 	
  * “It's an incredibly powerful feature flagging system, the best I have ever come across. So far it the uptime, and performance is perfect.”

 	
  * “Its awesome and is a key component in hitting uptime targets”

 	
  * “so easy to turn on and off functionality . Efficient, performance - wise.”

 	
  * “The service has been really reliable.”

 	
  * “We've had a case where a third party failed and was causing our systems to crash. Lucky we had a feature flag that covered that part of the code and was able to turn it off until the problem was resolved.”

 	
  * “Instant availability of changed/created flags. Super easy to create and change flags.”


**Less Risky, Better Releases**



 	
  * “I like the concept of using feature flags as it allows us to ship new features without having them complete. I've already recommended LaunchDarkly to a few of my developer friends. :)”

 	
  * “It has made releasing new features less stressful and made the release of features along with training and marketing materials a snap”

 	
  * “The ease of use through the user interface of the exclusion and inclusion is really helpful for my day-to-day. I can easily set up two different users, environments, etc. to test against a feature on vs. off. It also makes the release process less stressful!”


**Buy vs Build**



 	
  * “Feature toggling is critical and nobody should be writing code to solve a solved problem.”

 	
  * “Great tool replacing custom flagging mechanism, cost effective.”

 	
  * “It is easy to use, and way better than having to implement your own functionality”

 	
  * “It's cheaper than developing the capability yourself. Generally if something is not core to your business or something that differentiates you in the marketplace then I think you should try to outsource it to a 3rd party. Feature toggling is an excellent example of that.”

 	
  * “Provides all the functionality plus more that teams internally were building themselves”

 	
  * “It is a better "buy" of feature flags than any of us would reasonably "build”.”


**Business Users**



 	
  * “It allows us to offload management of which features are exposed to whom to our customer success team, so the engineering organization doesn't have to make a change in our database or build our own internal launch darkly.”

 	
  * “Saves our devs time and allows me to quickly tailor settings before demos, trainings, etc.”

 	
  * “Has completely changed how we're able to manage our release process. We now implement flags on each new feature and we can keep deploying as long as the build is green, the product/marketing teams are then responsible for launches once they're satisfied.”

 	
  * “Controlling features on the dashboard is incredibly easy for engineers to non-tech people”

 	
  * “Was really simple to get the developers to adopt, almost as frictionless to explain the concepts to the product/marketing teams.”


**As CEO & founder of LaunchDarkly, I love passing along kudos to our team:**



 	
  * “Thanks for making such an awesome product!”

 	
  * “Keep up the good work. Keen to see what you've got coming up.”

 	
  * “keep up the good work :)”

 	
  * “Awesome job!”

 	
  * “keep doing what you're doing’

 	
  * “LD seems like _such_ a small thing, but I think you've made a really good product”


As good as 50 NPS is, we still have room to improve, so we’ve set a target for 60. I’ve personally read all your feedback, and we’re looking forward to improving so our customers are even more likely to recommend us. Feel left out? Want to make your voice heard? Look in your email for your own invitation to our NPS survey - I really do read every one.
