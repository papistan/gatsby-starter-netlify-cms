LaunchDarkly now supports teams! Teams support means that you don't have to use shared credentials to access your account. Each individual member of your team gets their own login and password. If you already have a LaunchDarkly account, you can manage your team from your account settings page. You can invite new members here, or remove members that are no longer on your team.

We're going to continue adding features for teams over time-- stay tuned for more!
