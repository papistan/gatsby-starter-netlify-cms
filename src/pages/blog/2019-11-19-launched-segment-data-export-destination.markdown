We are excited to announce our new [Segment integration](https://segment.com/sources/launchdarkly/) for LaunchDarkly [Data Export](https://launchdarkly.com/features/data-export/)!

Teams use LaunchDarkly feature flags to manage everything from measured rollouts, experimenting on user experiences, enforcing pricing tiers, to infrastructure updates—all controlled by powerful targeting rules teams can tailor to their specific needs.

Each time a feature flag is evaluated [to decide which behavior should occur](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/evaluation-reasons), LaunchDarkly captures a critical decision point that teams can use to inform smarter business decisions. With our Data Export add-on, LaunchDarkly delivers feature flag evaluations in real-time for teams to combine with existing data sets and analyze user cohorts.

Connecting the new [Segment destination](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/segment-destination) to Data Export enables teams to pipe a real-time stream of raw event analytics directly into Segment. This, in turn, allows them to collect and standardize their customer data to construct enriched customer cohorts, monitor a rollout’s success with target demographics, or debug problems within the data analysis tools of their choice.

If you and your team would like to deliver and control your software more easily and intelligently, check out Data Export and the Segment integration.
