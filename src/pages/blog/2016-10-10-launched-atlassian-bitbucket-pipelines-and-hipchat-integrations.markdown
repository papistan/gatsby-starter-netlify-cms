We’re pleased to announce the launch of two LaunchDarkly integrations with Atlassian.

From “concept to launch,” Atlassian gives teams an integrated approach to build software. Now with LaunchDarkly, you can get more control over production rollout via Bitbucket Pipelines and HipChat integrations.

Feature flagging is a way of gating functionality to gain better control over a release - serve to a limited segment, get feedback and facilitate rollbacks without having to redeploy. LaunchDarkly helps teams to manage flags at scale. With a management platform in place, feature flags become prolific and it becomes even more significant to integrate these with your DevOps tools.

With LaunchDarkly, you can create and enable[ feature flags via Bitbucket Pipelines](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/bitbucket-pipelines), giving you the control you need to release confidently, reduce risk, and gather feedback on your new functionality.

With LaunchDarkly’s [HipChat integration](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/hipchat), you have visibility into all feature flag changes in real-time within your team’s collaboration tool.  See all changes to flags, including the team member making the change and the applicable environment, and do this without leaving your native workflow.

"Using Bitbucket Pipelines and LaunchDarkly together unlocks the true power of DevOps and continuous delivery. Our integration allows customers to have end to end feature control, for risk mitigation and quicker time to market," says Edith Harbaugh, CEO LaunchDarkly.

Together, LaunchDarkly's integration with Atlassian is bringing premier DevOps tools to the space.  Read about how Atlassian uses LaunchDarkly internally [here](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/07/inside-atlassian-building-products-devops/).
