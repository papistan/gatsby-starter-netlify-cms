I'm just getting started. (Image credit: [Viktor Hanecek](https://www.viktorhanacek.com/))

I'm excited to join [the LaunchDarkly team](https://launchdarkly.com/about-us/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic) after spending the last nine years at Atlassian Software. At Atlassian, I was one of the founding members of [their Technical Account Management team](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/services/tam). In a scant three years, we grew the program from two people to twenty, representing companies that are household names across the globe. I hope to take my experience and build a rockstar program here at LaunchDarkly.


### What is Technical Account Management (“TAM”)?


The purpose of the TAM program is to help our customers get the absolute most out of LaunchDarkly's capabilities. No two companies have quite the same needs, so we offer **directed**, **proactive**, and **strategic** guidance that is suited to each company. We take the time to learn how your teams work, to understand the various use cases that you have, and to collaborate with you to develop solutions to your needs.

One way to understand how new technologies come to be adopted is through the lens of **People**, **Process**, and **Technology — **the technologist's version of the three-legged stool**. **Within this analogy, the LaunchDarkly platform is the Technology leg. It offers a new and powerful capability, but it is only useful if the teams adopting it understand and internalize both what it does for them **and **how to implement it.

Particularly as teams scale and usage expands across the organization, there needs to be an ever-expanding center of knowledge. The learnings from the early wins with the platform need to evolve into a program of change. We're building the TAM program to help teams move from reactive troubleshooting and problem-solving to making proactive and strategic choices. I like to think of it as the difference between asking “What was this flag supposed to do?” to “How can we know that a release will be successful even before we launch it?”

Our aim with the TAM program is to be a trusted advisor. To be successful, we know that we first need to understand what you're trying to achieve before we can collaborate with you to get it across the line.


### What else do you do?


I've been working in tech for over a decade, and I can spend far too much time talking about the viability of various tech trends and movements. I've lived in the Bay Area for close to 30 years and am a bit of a foodie. In my spare time, boardgames have been a passion of mine for the last decade and a half: I'm mrwong on boardgamegeek.com.

Finally, I make a great mojito.
