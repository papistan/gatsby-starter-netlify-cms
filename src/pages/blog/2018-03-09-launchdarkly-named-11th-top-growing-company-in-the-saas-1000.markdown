We’re happy to share that LaunchDarkly was just named #11 on the [SaaS 1000](http://saas1000.com/) list for the first quarter of 2018. Based on our employee growth over six months and taking into account our overall size, we’ve been recognized as one of the top-growing SaaS companies out there. 

“The SaaS Sector continues its high growth. In fact, it has increased,” explains Tom Blue, who curates the SaaS 1000. “This quarter’s Top 1000 companies grew faster than last quarter’s list. Congrats to these accelerating companies.”

It’s true that LaunchDarkly has been growing rapidly—in December 2017, we raised [$21M in Series B funding](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/04/this-start-up-helps-companies-turn-new-features-on-and-off.html), bringing our total funding to $32.3M. In January 2018, we hit 20 billion features served for customers _per day_. We’re still only in the first quarter of 2018, and our plans for the rest of the year include even more growth. 

These accomplishments are thanks to our incredible, hardworking team led by CEO Edith Harbaugh. In December 2017, Edith was recognized in TechCrunch’s list of [42 Women in Tech Who Crushed It in 2017](https://techcrunch.com/gallery/a-look-at-42-women-in-tech-who-crushed-it-in-2017/) and was named #5 in CIO’s [Top 20 Female Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2018](https://www.cio.com/article/3243995/leadership-management/top-20-female-entrepreneurs-to-watch-in-2018.html).

As [Edith notes in this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGUVDHjQfeI&feature=youtu.be) with LaunchDarkly investor Redpoint Ventures, LaunchDarkly helps everybody who touches software. Our unified platform allows developer, product, marketing, sales, and customer success teams to manage code in real time, letting companies fine-tune features and improve customer experience. 

We help companies release their products, services, and updates at a pace that matches the speed of business. Instead of a major product launch every 1-3 years, companies that use LaunchDarkly can push out software updates continually and consistently. Not only does this eliminate risk and allow businesses to move quickly and constantly improve on their service and product, it also translates into greater value for the customer. Ultimately, LaunchDarkly helps our customers help their own customers succeed.

We’re defining a new category in SaaS: Feature management software. Whether disrupting an industry or working to remain competitive, every company wants to provide better service to customers. We are working with a broad base of cross-industry companies, including banking, insurance, shipping, ecommerce, and hardware, to bring clean, functional software to end-users without a hitch. 

Thanks to Tom Blue for including us in the SaaS 1000, and congratulations to the rest of the companies on the 2018 Q1 list!
