Modern development teams use a plethora of tools to support all aspects of the software delivery lifecycle. There is no single tool or solution that will support all of your needs. You need an ecosystem of tools that work together to support your engineering, testing, deployment, and operations processes. Our Trajectory sponsors included some of the tools in the ecosystem that help with these modern development processes. I took some time at Trajectory to speak with the sponsors and learn about their offerings.

Sponsors are a critical component for a conference. Sponsors can help to reduce the cost of tickets to attendees, they provide food and beverages, and they provide opportunities for additional learning. I encourage you the next time you attend a conference to stop by the sponsors and see what they have to teach you.


## Code Climate


[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) helps engineering teams visualize all steps of the engineering process and make data-driven decisions. They collect metrics from Git, tickets, and static information to create visualizations to help build high performing engineering teams. These visualizations help engineering teams see and understand what is happening. To learn more about Code Climate, consider attending their [one-day engineering leadership summit ](https://codeclimate.com/summit/)on May 22nd in San Francisco.


## Gremlin


[Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/) provides a full suite of tools for Chaos engineering. Chaos engineering was described to me like building resistance to the flu–you inject faults into your system to help build resilience. Running regular chaos experiments helps companies minimize risk by identifying where processes need to be improved or faults remedied. To get started with chaos engineering, Gremlin offers a free version which executes shutdown and CPU attacks. Gremlin's [ChaosConf](https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-conf-2019/) is on September 26th in San Francisco where you can learn about overcoming obstacles to deploy chaos engineering and how to achieve five nine's availability.


## Honeycomb


[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/overview/) offers complete observability of software and systems via logs, events, and traces to help companies build better software and resolve issues faster. With Honeycomb you know how production systems behave in real time. You can ask questions of your data and systems to understand whether a feature flag should be toggled off due to unexpected behavior. Observability from Honeycomb is where you go after you graduate from monitoring. Follow [Honeycomb on Twitter](https://twitter.com/honeycombio) to stay up to date on the latest observability trends.


## Percy


[Percy](https://percy.io/) offers automated testing to identify visual changes in new applications and ensure builds and code changes are shipped without visual bugs. With Percy, you can see how an application looks with a feature flag enabled or disabled. In addition to being a sponsor of LaunchDarkly they are also a customer. They recently published a blog on how they use [feature flags and visual testing](https://blog.percy.io/using-feature-flags-and-visual-testing-together-for-complete-launch-confidence-7429379cce0a) to gain confidence in testing feature flag variations.


## The New Stack


[The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/) publishes articles and podcasts about the services and infrastructure used by modern development teams. TC Currie correspondent from The New Stack was in attendance and shared her learnings on [The Context Podcast](https://thenewstack.io/context-launchdarklys-trajectory-google-cloud-next/).
