  * Respect and integrity for our team, our customers, and our community.

 	
  * We believe in teams, not fiefdoms. Leaders, not tyrants.

 	
  * We're building a place where you can learn and grow.

 	
  * Work is not life.


When John & I started LaunchDarkly, we’d known each other for years, since being undergraduates at Harvey Mudd College. Part of why we started the company together is that we shared common values about the company that we wanted to work at. As a founder, you’re not only building a product - you’re building a culture. 

As we got bigger, it was time to formalize our values from tribal “this is the way we work” knowledge to something more scalable. We surveyed our current team, and I was thrilled that, what I thought our values should be, the team already thought were in place. We reviewed our values at our last team meeting, and everyone gave an example of the time they’ve seen them practiced. 

“Values are valuable when you have a hard decision to make," is John's and my view. By making our values public, we hope both our customers and our team can know who we are.
