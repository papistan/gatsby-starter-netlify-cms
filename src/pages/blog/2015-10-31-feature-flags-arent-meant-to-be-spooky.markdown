[The prospect of shipping fast can be terrifying.](http://devops.com/2015/10/21/continuous-fear-shipping/) It’s human nature to want to hold on and ship only when something is perfect or complete.

But what’s scarier is the risk of shipping without being able to turn off a feature that’s not performing - or worse breaking something!

[LaunchDarkly ](https://launchdarkly.com/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic)is a new technology that makes releasing easier. By adding a feature flag via the LaunchDarkly platform when you ship something, it’s easier to measure the feedback. Then, if something is not quite right, you can flick the flag to reverse what you’ve shipped. This way there’s no painful rollback process.

LaunchDarkly becomes your garlic, your wooden stake, your silver bullet. You can fight against features that drain your company’s lifeblood with long iteration cycles.
