We're excited to announce that the LaunchDarkly SDK for Roku (BrightScript) is now available for use! With this announcement, the SDK has been promoted to general availability.

[Roku](https://www.roku.com/) is the industry leader in digital streaming devices. Whether customers are looking for content from YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, or another provider, they're more likely to look for it on Roku than on any other streaming service.

With the introduction of the LaunchDarkly SDK for Roku (BrightScript), developers can now use LaunchDarkly in their Roku apps just like they do in apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast, and other digital streaming services.

Many digital content providers maintain apps across multiple platforms. With this announcement, LaunchDarkly can now offer its powerful suite of functionality – feature management, progressive rollouts, experimentation, and more! – for a consistent developer experience across these companies' entire app suites. Toggling a LaunchDarkly feature flag can result in simultaneous behavioral changes across all platforms within a matter of milliseconds.

Check out the [Roku SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/roku-sdk-reference) for information on how to get started. There you can learn about how to embed the SDK in your app, view our open-source code, and run a sample application. If you have questions, reach out to our support team at [support@launchdarkly.com](mailto:support@launchdarkly.com).

Want to learn more about using LaunchDarkly with other streaming providers such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Google Chromecast? Read about our iOS and Android SDKs. These SDKs work across all devices running the [iOS](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/ios-sdk-reference) and [Android](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/android-sdk-reference) operating systems. If you're building client-side applications on other platforms such as [React Native](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/react-native-sdk-reference) or [Xamarin](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/xamarin-sdk-reference), we've got you covered. Similarly, with our server-side SDKs, you can use LaunchDarkly on most platforms in use today. Combine one of our client-side SDKs with any of our server-side SDKs to manage features across your entire application stack.

Don't see [your tech stack](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/getting-started#section-choosing-an-sdk) supported by our SDKs? [Email us](mailto:support@launchdarkly.com) and let us know!
