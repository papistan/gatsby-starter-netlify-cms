One of the things I like the most about attending conferences is learning new things. I learn from the speakers, attendees, and sponsors.  After the conference, I don't want the learning to stop so I always look for book recommendations at events.

I'm an avid reader. My "want to read" list on Goodreads currently is at 116 books. And last weekend I quietly celebrated a milestone–almost 5 years after joining Goodreads I marked my 200th book as read.

Trajectory did not disappoint in this area. Numerous books, articles, and podcasts were mentioned. Some of them relate directly to DevOps, such as _The DevOps Handbook_, and _Project to Product_. Others are more generally about organizational transformation, such as _Turn The Ship Around_. Many of our speakers cited the breakout DevOps book of last year, _Accelerate_. Whatever you decide to read, or listen to, we hope that this list and the Trajectory videos, when they are available, will give you new resources for thinking about how you create, test, and launch your products.
