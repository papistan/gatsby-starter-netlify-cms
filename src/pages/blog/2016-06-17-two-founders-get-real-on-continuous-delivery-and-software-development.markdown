Since last August, Edith Harbaugh and Paul Biggar have been making continuous delivery and software development way more fun.  The two are co-hosts of the podcast [To Be Continuous](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/), hosted by HeavyBit industries. To Be Continuous is part history lesson, part comedy show, and part an education in software best and worst practices.  They have discussed everything from the dirty secrets of product management to the true meaning of SaaS.  

The two are in the continuous integration/continuous delivery space - Edith as co-founder and CEO of [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic) and Paul as founder of [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).  They mix their own experiences with quintessential industry case studies to capture the real zeitgeist of the software industry in the Bay Area.

Here’s what people are saying about it:

Even after 20 episodes and 21 hours of conversation, there’s still plenty left to discuss.  Do you have a topic you’d like to see Paul and Edith cover?  Ping them at @ContinuousCast.
