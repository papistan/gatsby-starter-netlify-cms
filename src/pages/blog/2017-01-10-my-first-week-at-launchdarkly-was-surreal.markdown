**The Space**
LaunchDarkly’s office space is located inside Heavybit. The building has an industrial theme and feel with metal and wood everywhere. I’m surrounded by three walls of windows that provides natural light on an open floor plan. So warm and beautiful...but that’s just the start. Heavybit provides many interesting amenities such as meetup space, workshops, not to mention a kitchen full of drinks and snacks, and lunch served everyday. The service has been amazing, keep up the great work Heavybit!

**Day One?**
I joined on the company’s first day of the new year. Everyone’s back from the holidays, telling stories, exchanging ideas, working, having lunch together and going to a few meetings. The team and leadership were very welcoming and helpful to get me up and running. It felt like a “low key” day compared to a day at my past startups. However, as the days go on I realized that this kind of day is EVERY day at LaunchDarkly. Every day leadership is there to guide and support the team, and vice versa. Everyone is at arm's reach and easy to talk to. Which I love because it keeps meetings to a minimum and allows autonomy to GSD. Working with this intelligent, colorful and compassionate group has exceeded my expectations of what startup culture can be. 

**I am One with the Force...**
At the end of the week, I felt I was contributing to a great team building an awesome product that is helping companies produce more awesome products and services. As a business operations person, this is music to my ears - be a force multiplier!


In weeks to come, I look forward to taking on challenges and growing the team. I’m excited to learn from and contribute to the LaunchDarkly community.
