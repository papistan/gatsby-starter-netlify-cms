### We've launched a Slack app!


We're excited for you to use this integration to surface feature changes to members of all project teams that might benefit from seeing them, and to smooth workflows by allowing you to view, monitor, and interact with flags from within your regular Slack workspace. You can get started today—find it in the [Slack app directory](https://slack.com/apps/AKEEF9DTM-launchdarkly).

If the app has already been installed in your workspace you can get started right away by typing `/launchdarkly` in any channel or DM.

### How could this help me?


If your team is like ours you might find yourself discussing a feature flag with your teammates or sharing ownership of the right target states.

You can use the Slack app to collaborate on flags by filtering and viewing your flags directly from your workspace, subscribing to flag updates in relevant project channels, and receiving notifications to stay on top of any changes. You can subscribe to a set of flags **or** to individual flags—this works well for team awareness and collaboration in project channels, or general tracking in log channels.

For example:



 	
  * You want to closely monitor a flag that controls customer billing, so you subscribe to this flag in a direct message or channel

 	
  * While on a retention project, you subscribe to flags **tagged** retention-experiment in your `#retention-experiment` channel

 	
  * You can subscribe your entire #Ops channel to flags within the Operations **Project **in LaunchDarkly

 	
  * Subscribing to **all flags** or a large subset of flags creates a `#changelog` channel that is easy to stand up and manage




### What does it do, exactly?


Subscribing to flags will send change notifications to everyone who is in the channel:

You can view flag details from within Slack. It's also easy to view a flag summary any time you reference a flag by pasting a LaunchDarkly URL in your Slack workspace:

The app also lets you toggle flag targeting on and off from within Slack, which can save time for simple flags:

You'll be able to use slash commands to subscribe to and manage different notifications:
