Introducing the new [mParticle integration](https://www.mparticle.com/integration/launchdarkly) for LaunchDarkly [Data Export](https://launchdarkly.com/features/data-export/)!

Teams use LaunchDarkly feature flags to control rollouts, enforce pricing tiers, experiment on user experiences, and orchestrate infrastructure updates — all neatly organized with powerful targeting rules teams can tailor to their specific needs.

In each of these cases, feature flags are evaluated to [decide what behavior should occur](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/evaluation-reasons), and LaunchDarkly captures critical decision-point data teams can use to make smarter decisions. With our Data Export add-on, LaunchDarkly provides feature flag evaluations in real-time for teams to analyze user cohorts and combine with existing data sets.

Integrating the new [mParticle destination](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/mparticle-destination) with Data Export enables teams to pipe a real-time stream of raw event analytics directly into mParticle. Once in mParticle, that data is unified to single customer profiles and utilized to create enriched customer audiences that can be activated across the tech stack in real-time. Using mParticle’s identity capabilities, it’s possible to monitor a rollout’s success with target demographics or debug problems in a specific analysis tool without ever having to worry about duplicate customer profiles, manual list management, or data being siloed in different tools.

If you and your team would like to make smarter decisions with your customer data, check out Data Export and the mParticle integration.
