LaunchDarkly now provides live status indicators for your feature flags. Our dashboard shows you which flags are active, which are candidates to be removed from your code, and which have already been deleted from your code, and are safe to remove from our dashboard.

This is the first of many new features we're building to help developers manage feature flags throughout their development process. Cleaning up feature flags is an essential part of the development workflow, and LaunchDarkly is taking steps to make this as easy as possible. Happy launching!
