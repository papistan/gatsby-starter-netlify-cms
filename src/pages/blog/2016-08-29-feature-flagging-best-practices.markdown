****While there are many companies who practice feature flagging as a way to extend continuous delivery and release faster, there are just as many companies who are just starting out with the practice.  And until now, there hasn’t been a great resource for the feature flagging beginner.  Feature flagging as a concept is super straightforward, but must be implemented with diligence.  Haphazard feature flags can devastate a company, whereas well-managed flags can prevent disaster and even make your company more competitive.  ****

****
[LaunchDarkly’s guide to feature flagging best practices](http://featureflags.io/feature-flag-introduction/?utm_source=launchdarkly_blog&utm_medium=organic) addresses these deficiencies and provides a roadmap for better feature flag management.  While many aspects of feature flagging must be personalized to meet a particular company’s needs, the guide acquaints newcomers with how powerful feature flags can be and what they need to watch out for.  It also relays some pro tips for those who have been feature flagging for a while.  ****
