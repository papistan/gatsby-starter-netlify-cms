We hit a few **big** milestones this quarter, including growing our customer base 500% in the past year as new customers like Docker, TrueCar, and ProCore joined the LaunchDarkly family. And, we’re particularly proud that our growing family is a happy one: [our NPS is an industry-leading 50](https://blog.launchdarkly.com/leading-feature-flag-platform-launchdarkly-announces-industry-topping-nps/), a full 20% higher than tech’s average. Just to put this in context, we’re now serving more than ten billion feature flags daily (we thought we had hit it big [we surpassed one billion daily flags last year](https://blog.launchdarkly.com/launchdarkly-now-serving-billions-of-feature-flags-at-warp-speed/)). 

In short, the theme of this quarter is **big**. 

We’re grateful to announce this week that [Gartner has recognized us as a “2017 Cool Vendor”](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3706719?ref=AnalystProfile&srcId=1-4554397745) in DevOps Technologies for our feature management service, which removes a significant barrier to mainstream adoption of feature flags, a Continuous Deployment best practice. Gartner also recognized innovative tech compatriots [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Bugsee](https://www.bugsee.com/?utm_campaign=Brand_Non-Free&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc), [Conjur](https://www.conjur.com/) and [OrcaConfig](https://www.orcaconfig.com/). 

Whether you’re releasing once a quarter or on the hour, we can help your team eliminate risk inherent with moving faster. We give back control over your releases through percentage rollouts, feature kill switches for unexpected events, and better user feedback through code driven A/B testing.  

It’s not about moving fast and breaking things; it’s about moving fast and being ready for the unexpected.  With over ten billion features being served every day, we’re ready for you.
